A simple qt6 frontend for [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) written in Python using PySide6.

- Supports downloading mp3 and mp4
- Supports downloading & embedding subtitles
- Allows you to download and work with multiple URLs at once
- Automatically embeds video chapters, thumbnails & metadata

## Support

The easiest way to support this project is to star it on GitHub. You can also support the developer by making a [donation](https://downloader.markopejic.com/donate).

## Status

Development in this repository is currently **limited to maintenance and bug fixes only**. When I will have the time, I will do a complete rewrite of the app and implement some of the missing features / ideas I have.

## Goals

This project aims to create an application that:

- automates things that would have to be done manually on other similar frontends
- only has the most used features
- has a powerful yet simple and streamlined user interface
- is lightweight and has a small amount of dependencies

## Contributing

Any contributions are highly appreciated as long as they follow the project's goals.

## Planned features

- Settings menu with more customization options
- Installer & automatic updates on Windows
- Remember previously used settings
- Support for macOS

## Dependencies (for running from source)

Apart from a few Python packages, listed in [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt), only [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) is required.
