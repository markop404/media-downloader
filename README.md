## About

A simple Qt frontend for [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) written in Python.

- Supports [hundreds of websites](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/supportedsites.md)
- Supports downloading mp3 and mp4
- Supports downloading & embedding subtitles
- Allows you to download and work with multiple URLs at once
- Automatically embeds video chapters, thumbnails & metadata
- Supports cropping thumbnails / album arts to square shape (useful when downloading music)

## Status

Development in this repository is currently **limited to maintenance and bug fixes only**. When I will have the time, I will do a complete rewrite of the app and implement some of the missing features / ideas I have.

## Support

The easiest way to support this project is to star it on GitHub. You can also support the developer by making a [donation](https://downloader.markopejic.com/donate).

## Goals

This project aims to create an application that:

- automates things that would have to be done manually on other similar frontends
- only has the most used features
- has a powerful yet simple and streamlined user interface
- is lightweight and has a small amount of dependencies

## Contributing

- Settings menu with more customization options
- Installer & automatic updates on Windows
- Remember previously used settings
- Support for macOS
